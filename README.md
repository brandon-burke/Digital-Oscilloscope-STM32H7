# Digital-Oscilloscope-STM32H7

This project is based around the STM32H745 microcontroller and a ILI9341 TFT display to create a digital oscilloscope. 
The folder provided (CM7) is where all the code is contained and by it's name suggest that it uses the MCUs Cortex M7 
processor to carry out this task. You will need STMs LL drivers for the stm32h7 to properly support some functions in 
this project.

Reference manuals to the components used are provided as well.
